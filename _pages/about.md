Hi! I am currently the head of Language And Science AI Lab (LASA) of [DAMO Academy of Alibaba Group](https://damo.alibaba.com/). I am generally interested in developing the novel and efficient models with various complex data structures, includeing graphs and sequences to tackle real-world challenges, particularly in the realm of Language and Science.

Prior joining DAMO Academy, I served as a principal researcher at [Tencent AI Lab](https://ai.tencent.com/) for seven years. I briefly served as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. I received Ph.D degree at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/) in 2016, under the supervision of Professor [Hong CHENG](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~hcheng/). Before that I obtained my B.S. degree with honors from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/).
